# process-management-system
This is the assignment project of System programming course.
Process management system handles processes (here processes means commands that are accepted from file or 
created by user). 
I have used concepts like file/IO , process and signals of system programming.
These processes are dynamically created using fork() and exec() system calls.
And it provides different functions to create and manage the processes and see the status of the processes.
